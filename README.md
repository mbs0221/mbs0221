# Benshan Mei 👋  

I am working as a Postdoc Researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Haibo Chen](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/zh/pub/members/haibo_chen/) and [Prof. Yubin Xia](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/zh/pub/members/yubin_xia/) . I received my Ph.D. degree in June 2025 from the State Key Laboratory of Cyberspace Security Defense (SKLCSD), Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

My research focuses on Confidential Computing and Hardware-Assisted Security.

## About Me  
I have a diverse technical background, starting with **Android and web development** before transitioning into **machine learning research** during my master’s studies, where I focused on **multi-task learning**. My exposure to **federated learning** and **AI security & privacy** made me realize the critical security challenges in AI, leading me to shift my focus towards **confidential computing**. During my Ph.D., I specialized in **low-level system security for confidential virtual machines (CVMs)**, exploring **secure system architectures, hardware-assisted security, virtualization security, and trusted execution environments (TEE)**, under the guidance of [Prof. Dongdai Lin](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~ddlin) and [Prof. Wenhao Wang](https://heartever.github.io/). My Ph.D. thesis is titled **Research on the Privilege Separation Mechanisms in Confidential Virtual Machines**.

## Research Interests  
🔹 **Confidential Computing** – CVM security, TEE, virtualization security  
🔹 **AI Security & Privacy** – federated learning, adversarial ML, secure AI training & inference  

I am passionate about building secure and efficient system architectures to enable next-generation privacy-preserving computing. Let’s connect! 🚀
