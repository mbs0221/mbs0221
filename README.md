### About Me  
I have a diverse technical background, starting with **Android and web development** before transitioning into **machine learning research** during my masterâ€™s studies, where I focused on **multi-task learning**. My exposure to **federated learning** and **AI security & privacy** in 2019 made me realize the critical security challenges in AI, leading me to shift my focus towards **confidential computing**.

During my Ph.D., I specialized in **low-level system security for confidential virtual machines (CVMs)**, exploring **secure system architectures, hardware-assisted security, virtualization security, and trusted execution environments (TEE)**. My Ph.D. thesis is titled **Research on the Privilege Separation Mechanisms in Confidential Virtual Machines**.

### Research Interests  
ðŸ”¹ **Confidential Computing** â€“ CVM security, TEE, virtualization security  
ðŸ”¹ **AI Security & Privacy** â€“ federated learning, adversarial ML, secure AI training & inference  

I am passionate about building secure and efficient system architectures to enable next-generation privacy-preserving computing. Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
