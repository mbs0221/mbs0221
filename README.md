## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

### About Me  
I have a diverse technical background, starting with **Android and web development** before transitioning into **machine learning research** during my masterâ€™s studies, where I focused on **multi-task learning**.  

My exposure to **federated learning** and **AI security & privacy** made me realize the critical security challenges in AI, leading me to shift my focus towards **confidential computing**. During my Ph.D., I specialized in **low-level system security for confidential virtual machines (CVMs)**, exploring **secure system architectures, virtualization security, and trusted execution environments (TEE)**.  

### Research Interests  
ðŸ”¹ **Confidential Computing** â€“ CVM security, TEE, virtualization security  
ðŸ”¹ **AI Security & Privacy** â€“ federated learning, adversarial ML, secure AI training & inference  

I am passionate about building secure and efficient system architectures to enable next-generation privacy-preserving computing. Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€
